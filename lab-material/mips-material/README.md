Here I will put spim-related material I found freely available and useful, mostly for implementing procedure calls but also
some nice spim examples and the manual.

SPIM is a MIPS architecture simulator which runs on all platforms (starting with QtSpim)

Here is the website for SPIM as of 2017 :
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/">QtSpim</a>

This is a good tutorial for understanding <a href="http://logos.cs.uic.edu/366/notes/mips%20quick%20tutorial.htm">MIPS program structure</a>

And this is a comprehensive manual for <a href="http://www.egr.unlv.edu/~ed/MIPStextSMv11.pdf">MIPS using Qtspim</a>.
