The grammar file compiled OK.
Grammarians:
   Please do  NOT use <index, parameter> at
     the end of elements. It is used for model training.
   Use plain grammar entries instead.
Modelers:
   Please DO NOT change that information manually.
   When you add new entries to an already-indexed grammar,
     put ALL OF THEM at the END of the grammar file.
   In model updates, make new entries WITHOUT extra information.
