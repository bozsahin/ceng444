To use this code, do <code>python g2lisp.py</code>

And follow the instructions there.

In the folder there are source files for a natural language grammar.

This grammar is parsed into IC code in the form of a python dict for source's AST.

The current IC code generates target code in the form of Common Lisp expressions.

In g2lisp.py code you can see sly a fairly involved sly lexer and parser.

enjoy.
