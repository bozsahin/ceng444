antLR, LALR, MIPS, SPIM, Lisp material go here.

antLR is easier from its complete jar file. Build can be trick (it was to me).

We don't need developer tools like maven for antLR.

Keep an eye on potential incompatibility between antLR's compile-time java libraries
and your run-time java libraries.

Just get your Java RE and JDK in sync; it should be OK.
