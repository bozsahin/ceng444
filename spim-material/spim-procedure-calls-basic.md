Here is a more basic link for explaining the preparations that need to be done 
at assembly level before, during, and after a procedure call, in SPIM.

One example here (basics) is copied here because git does not support ftp links. sorry CS201.

The example is a hand translation of a function call to SPIM, not to be confused with
compiler generated code, which should give the behavior.
