<b>Project 2:</b> Write an LALR-based code  generator for V, and execute your sample code.

<p>You can generate MIPS, RISC-V or LLVM code.  I cover MIPS in class because it is the tried and true one.

<p>Test your sample V code with a native machine if you have one, or use on of the great simulators such
as QtSpim for MIPS or Spike for RISC-V. 

<p>These emulators are in fact better, because they allow you to debug your code generator by showing
the ``machine state'' all the time, and during register updates. 

<p>For this phase, you may assume that all input is well-formed syntactically and semantically, that is, it is executable
with a meaningful response.

<p>Zip your source, inputs and demo of output to send to me in one file.
