These are slides from the authors of the textbook, which are used at Rice university compilers course.

Used with their kind permission. Please note in the introduction slides
their request not to use them for profit. I suggest you do not distribute the material.

I will use some parts of it, and supplement them with my own slides on LALR parsing, syntax-directed translation,
code templates, etc.etc.
